Web Application Development


For this project, the team is formed with Andrei Popescu, Jullia Birsan, Roxana Radescu & Ashab Obeida.
The team leader is Andrei Popescu.

We decided to build a web application for finding events around you and buy tickets for them.

For explaining it, I chose to describe some user stories.
S1. The user will be able to register and login with an account.
S2. The user can see a list with the coming events on its homepage.
S3. The user can access a list with his saved/past events.
S4. The user can see details for each event & can save them for later.
S5. The user can buy tickets and see a list of events he needs to attend.

We'll update the documentation on the go, as we will develop the application.
